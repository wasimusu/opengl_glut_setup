### OpenGL setup with GLUT

We are setting up the following:
- OpenGL
- GLUT
- GLEW

Download the following:
- OpenGL is included with windows. No need to download.
- Download the freeGLUT for MSVC or MINGW from https://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/
- Download the GLEW from https://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/

The lib, dll and bin folder of freeGLUT belong should be pasted in the MINGW directory. It also has the same structure.
So basically lib of freeGLUT and lib of MINGW get merged and so on.

The same goes for GLEW as well.
